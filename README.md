## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to improve my CSS skills with the feedback that I received in my previous project [3 columns challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/3-columns-challenger-solution-Mf4r7cFS4). Also I added a :focus-visible in some interactive elements (links, buttons) for people who use tab to navigate through the site. My main idea for this project was use all my knowledge about HTML and CSS and the feedback that I received to improve my code and make it more readable and organized.
